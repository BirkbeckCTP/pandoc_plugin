# Pandoc Plugin

This is a plugin for [Janeway](https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway) that provides a button for typesetters to automatically generate html or xml files from user article submissions in docx/rtf. These files are first converted to markdown, and from there to html or xml, and then registered as galleys of the originaly article.

*N. B. You must have pandoc installed on your server to use this plugin. Please see pandoc's installation documentation __[here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)__.*
